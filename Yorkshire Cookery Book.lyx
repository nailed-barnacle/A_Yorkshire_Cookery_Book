This little Book of Cookery Recipes is issued with the object in the first
 place of helping the Funds of the Women's Patriotic Guild (a Branch of
 Queen Mary's Needlework Guild), at 178 Westgate, the house that has been
 kindly lent to us by the Corporation of Wakefield, where garments are being
 made for our Soldiers at the Front, and for the wounded in the Hospitals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was also anxious to make a collection of Recipes that would be useful
 in households where economy is studied, and owing to the kindness of many
 friends and helpers, I hope to accomplish both objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the Recipes and Subsriptions of 1s.
 have been sent to me by people living in the West Riding, and in some cases
 I know the 1s.
 could ill be spared.
 Let me tell one story that I heard.
 In a house where there are several young children, and the greatest frugality
 has to be practised habitually, an offer was made to the lady who was collectin
g for the book.
 "I'd like to give you somethin' for't book if it's to help 't lads at t'
 front." "But I'm sure you've enough to do to make ends meet" remonstrated
 the visitor.
 "Aye, but you can always give summat if you try." And this woman, with her
 large household of hungry mouths, insisted upon giving a recipe and 1s.
 Later on one of her boys asked, "Mother, aren't we having no ginger-cake
 this week?" "No lad, I give some money to help to send shirts and socks
 to t'soldier's" was the reply.
 "Never mind, Mother, we'll willingly do without cake if it's to help t'brave
 lads at t'front," said the boy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are plenty of people who are willing to deny themselves luxuries in
 this country, and if there are some women who grumble about "this jiggering
 old War which stops you getting anything you want," there is one comfort
 - their numbers are probably small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have taken some Recipes from French books, and several from very old collectio
ns of Recipes.
 There is one from a roll of ancient English Cookery, dated about 1390,
 which I have inserted as a curiosity.
 Such recipes have little practical value, as the quantities are so seldom
 given, but it is interesting to see how all through history Cookery was
 esteemed as a high art.
 The luxury of the Romans is well known, and their food was most elaborately
 dressed.
 Fish was conveyed for their tables by men who ran all the way from the
 coast, in order that the fish might be brought alive to the cooks.
 It was the fashion also to make one thing pass for another.
 At a supper given by Petronius, "the cook sent up a fat goose, fish and
 wild fowl of all sorts in appearance, but still all were made out of the
 several parts of one single porker."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the kings were famous for their elaborate cuisine, William the Conqueror
, William Rufus, and Richard II.
 kept very good tables, and the nobles and prelates were not slow to follow
 their example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subtleties were a great feature in the banquets of the 15th century.
 They were frequently made of sugar and wax and wore designed to give pleasure
 to the eye as well as the taste.
 "A pelican sitting on her, nest with her young," and "an image of St.
 Catherine holding a book and disputing with the Doctors," are instanced
 as two subtleties in an old book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In spite of great luxury in the way of food, manners at table developed
 slowly, as is shown by the different books written upon the subject.
 Forks were introduced into Italy in the 11th century, but they were not
 common in England even in the 17th century.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Charles the XII.
 of Sweden, buttered his bread with his thumb, and the early books on table
 etiquette show that there was a very imperfect standard of manners.
 Those who sat at table were to wash their hands before the meal, not to
 speak with their mouths full, not to put too much on the trencher at once,
 not to drop sauce or soup on their clothes.
 Bread served at the table was not to be broken or bitten off the loaf.
 Big 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of bread were cut to serve as plates, and on these the meats were placed;
 in time they became soaked through with the gravy, and after the meal was
 over these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tranchers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were distributed amongst the poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recorded that the Queen of Charles V.
 of France (the Wise) "agreeable to an old and laudable custom, for preventing
 any idle or loose thought at table had a learned man, who, during the meal,
 related the actions, or made an eulogium on some deceased person, especially
 of one eminent in piety." This custom may have had its disadvantages, but
 I should prefer it to the music which so often accompanies a meal at the
 present day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I should like to take this opportunity of offering my warmest and most grateful
 thanks to all those ladies who have helped me by collecting and contributing
 Recipes and Funds for this book.
 My thanks also are due to Mr.
 Hermann Senn, G.C.A., A.I.J., for his kindness in allowing me to include some
 Recipes from his book, "Cookery for Invalids and the Convalescent," and
 I wish to acknowledge at the same time the kind permission which has been
 given to me to insert some Economical Recipes from the Handbook for Housewives,
 which is issued by the National Food Economy League.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the good Housewives of the West Riding, who, in the words of an 18th
 Century Preface, study "the art of adorning their tables with a splendid
 frugality," I commend this Book of Recipes, begging them to remember that
 every 1/6 spent upon a copy will go to help in supplying much needed garments
 to our men at the Front.

 (the 5th).

Excepting for a few small details which include the change in the price
 owing to the increased cost of production, I have made no alterations,
 as I think the original subscribers may like to see the book practically
 as it was when first published.
 The royalties paid to me on the sale of copies will be devoted to the assistanc
e of Ex-Soldiers.
 I recall with gratitude the help given to me at Westgate during the War,
 and I hope the new edition of "A Yorkshire Cookery Book

RECIPE FOR MAKING AND PRESERVING FRIENDS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select some sound hearts, be very careful not to bruise them with unfeeling
 words.
 Take the milk of human kindness, one heartful; add to this plenty of tact,
 warm the mixture with sympathy, but do not let it get too hot at the first,
 else it will only ferment mischief.
 Knead it with plenty of the Oil of Unselfishness to make all smooth, and
 beware of jars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mixture should be kept in a warm corner of the heart, and years only
 serve to improve the flavour of friends thus preserved.

Transcriber's note
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transcribing this book has been an unexpected pleasure.
 I was born in Wakefield in 1960 and grew up in Horbury; the names of streets
 and families are very familiar to me.
 I went to school with descendants of many of these contributors; in one
 case a 
\lang british
favourite
\lang english
 teacher's family appears.
 I found nothing from my own family - from Normanton and Horsforth before
 Wakefield - but found one recipe from the Wakefield street in which I was
 born and a number from the Vicarage at Horbury Bridge where I lived for
 ten years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have attempted throughout to maintain the spacing, punctuation, abbreviations,
 and general typographical layout as used by the original publisher.
 The scanning and optical character recognition of such an old and fragile
 book is tricky, but any errors in transcription are mine alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Weights and Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All measurements here are of course Imperial; pounds (lbs.) and ounces (ozs.);
 pints, gills, and quarts.
 A dram is a sixteenth of an ounce (it's used in some of the wine recipes).
 American readers should remember that the Imperial pint is twenty ounces
 and not sixteen; a gill is a quarter of an Imperial pint and so five fluid
 ounces; and a quart is two Imperial pints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the UK, dried goods are traditionally measured by weight and only rarely
 by volume; that is usually reserved for fluids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I grew up as the UK changed from Imperial to metric measures in the early
 seventies so translation is automatic for me, but to assist with metric
 conversion: an ounce is approximately 28 grams; a pound approximately 454
 grams, and a pint approximately 568 millilitres.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time (and long after I left home), yeast was always sold as live
 yeast; about an ounce sufficed for a large loaf.
 An equivalent today is perhaps one of the 7 gram packets of dried yeast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the occasional '1d.
 worth of...' - that's a penny worth, and at this point your guess is as good
 as mine.

 pint hot water, 1 tablespoonful flour, 1 egg, 4 peppercorns, salt.
 Prepare the fish, cut it into slices not too thin, put it into a stewpan
 with the hot water, vinegar, salt, and peppercorns.
 Simmer very gently about 15 minutes, taking care the slices do not break,
 then lift them out carefully and keep hot.
 Mix the butter and flour to a smooth paste, stir into it by degrees the
 water in which the fish has been cooked, pour it into a small saucepan,
 and stir until boils and thickens.
 Then add the parsley finely chopped, and the egg well beaten, season to
 taste and pour over the fish.
 If liked, the egg can be boiled hard, the white cut into small dice before
 adding to the sauce, and the yolk be rubbed through a sieve or strainer
 on to the fish after it is covered with the sauce.
 This way looks prettier, but it is not suitable for invalids, as the albumen
 in the white of the egg becomes indigestible by boiling hard.

TO MAKE FRENCH CUTLETS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Skin a loin of mutton and cut into steaks, then take some of the lean of
 a leg of veal, the weight in beef suet, two anchovies, thyme, parsley,
 sweet marjoram, and onion, all finely shred, nutmeg, pepper, and salt,
 and grated bread, with the yolks of two eggs; make holes in the lean of
 the steaks and fill them full of this seasoning and spread it all over
 the steaks, then butter as many pieces of white paper as you have cutlets,
 and wrap them up every one by themselves, turn up the edges of the papers
 with great care that none of the moisture gets out; therefore let the papers
 be large enough to turn up several times at the edge; and if occasion be,
 stick a pin to keep it all in, for this gravy is all their sauce; when
 they are thus tight wrapped up, put them on a mazereen and bake them.
 When they are enough take them off the dish they were baked on, and put
 them on a hot clean dish; do not take the papers off, but serve them in
 as they were baked.
 This is a very delicious savoury dish and done with little danger of spoiling
 if you wrap them up close.
 Many people like these best without sauce, but if you choose it, let it
 be strong gravy, spice, onion, shred capers, juice of lemon shook up with
 a bit of butter, but they are savoury and most wholesome alone.

 It will look neater if boiled in a basin, well buttered, than when boiled
 in a pudding cloth, well floured; boil it an hour and three-quarters- but
 the surest way is to stew the apples first in a stewpan with a wine-glassful

 Some people like it flavoured with cloves, and lemon peel, and sweeten

 sugar, and the yolks of sixteen eggs ; beat all together in the mortar
 until it is all one colour; then pour it into your dish in which you have

 I think grating the peel saves trouble and does it finer and thinner than
 you can shred or beat it.
 But you must beat up the butter and sugar with it and the eggs with all

 beat to a froth–put the froth to the sugar by degrees, lest the whole should
 make the icing too soft, and then it will run; it requires a great deal
 of beating.
 It must be put on when the cake is very near cold, and be spread as straight
 as possible at once, and not touched again; lay in on the top first, then
 the sides; let it stand still after it is done, and not near the fire.

Cut the plant in April; boil the stalks in salt and water until tender;

 place it in a syrup and allow it to remain there 3 or 4 days, closely covered.
 The syrup must be made from the same weight of sugar that there is of fruit,
 allowing 1 pint water to 1 lb.
 sugar, and must be boiled twice a day, and poured over the fruit until
 it is nearly all absorbed, after which it should be put in a pie dish and
 placed near the fire to dry.
 Time to make about 10 days.
 I always find May or early in June quite time enough to cut, and the plant
 grows up again that year.

To a lb.
 of Apricocks before they are stoned and pared, take a lb.
 and a quarter of double-refined sugar; stone and pare your apricocks and
 have your sugar finely beat; as you pare them lay some sugar under and
 over them; when the sugar is pretty well melted, set them on the fire and
 boil them; keep some sugar out to strew on them in the boiling to keep
 their colour; and as the scum rises take it off very clean and sometimes
 turn them with the ladle as you see occasion; when they are tender put
 them into glasses.
 Add to your syrup a quarter of a pint of pippin liquor, and the weight
 of it in sugar and let it boil a while; put it to your apricocks; let your
 fire be quick, for the sooner any white sweetmeat is done 'twill took the
 better.
 You may let the liquor run through a jelly bag if you would have it delicately
 clear.

 Be sure to keep them close stopped.
 A spoonful of this pickle is good in fish or any savoury sauce.

TO PICKLE CODLINS LIKE MANGOE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg, into which
 put half a hundred of the fairest and largest codlins you can get; they
 must be full grown, but not full ripe, let them lie in this brine nine
 or ten days, shifting the pickle every other day, then dry them and very
 carefully scoop out the core.
 Take out the stalks so whole as they may fit in again, and you may leave
 the eye in if you do not put your scoop quite through; fill it in the room
 of the core, with ginger sliced thin, and cut short, a clove of garlick,
 and whole mustard seed, as much as it will hold.
 Put in the piece and tie it up tight.
 Make your, pickle of as much white wine vinegar as will cover them, with
 sliced ginger, cloves of garlick and whole mustard seed.
 Pour this pickle boiling hot upon them every other day for a fortnight
 or three weeks.
 Stone jars are best for all sorts of pickle; and this is as good a way
 as any for a middling large cucumber; only do not cut them to put the garlick
 and mustard-seed in, for they keep much longer and eat much crisper if
 you let them be whole.
 But neither cucumber, peaches, nor melons are comparable to codlins for
 imitating the right mangoe.

\begin_layout Standard
In March bore a hole in a tree, and put in a faucet, and it will run two
 or three days together without hurting the tree, then put in a pin to stop
 it, and the next year you may draw as much from the same hole; put to every
 gallon of the liquor a quart of good honey, and stir it well together,
 boil it an hour, scum it well and put in a few cloves and a piece of lemon
 peel; when 'tis almost cold put to it so much ale-yeast as will make it
 work like a new ale, and when the yeast begins to settle, put it in a runlet
 that will just hold it; so let it stand six weeks or longer if you please;
 then bottle it and in a month you may drink it.
 It will keep a year or two.
 You may make it with sugar, two pounds to a gallon, or something more,
 if you keep it long.
 This is admirably wholesome, as well as pleasant, an opener of obstructions,
 good against the phthisick, and good against the spleen and scurvey; a
 remedy for the stone, it will abate heat in a fever or thrush, and has
 been given with good success.

 and the taste of turnips will be discharged both from the milk and from
 the butter made of it.

\begin_layout Standard
When making sweet sauce for pudding, you will find it much easier to mix
 if the sugar is added to the flour before the milk.
 If mustard is mixed with a little milk and a pinch of salt instead of with
 water, it brings the flavour out better and keeps its colour much longer
 when it is put into the castor.

TO PREVENT FRUIT FALLING IN CAKES.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In making currant or sultana cakes the fruit sometimes falls to the bottom
 of the cake, causing it to become heavy and unpalatable.
 This may be attributed to the fact that the cake mixture was too liquid,
 a, frequent occurence when milk is used without the addition of one or
 more eggs.
 Baking at too low a temperature will also tend to the same result, the
 butter dissolving before the beat required to burst the starch granules
 of the flour has been reached.

Take rue, wormwood, sage, lavender, mint and rosemary, of each one handful;
 put them all together, with a gallon of the best vinegar, into a stone
 jar covered over with paste and let them stand within the warmth of the
 fire to infuse for eight days; then strain them off, and to every quart
 bottle put three quarters of an ounce of camphire.
 Let the camphire be dissolved before it is put into the bottles.
 Rub the temples and loins with this preparation before going out in the
 morning., wash the mouth, snuff up some of it into the nostrils and carry
 a piece of spunge that has been dipt in it to smell to pretty often.
